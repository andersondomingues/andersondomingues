# Hi there! I'm Anderson Domingues ðŸ‘‹

Here's who I am:

- ðŸ‘¯ A PhD student, currently working on a new manycore (system-on-chip) with support Real-Time communication. I've been working on my MsC and Phd for years, from which I learned a lot about hardware-software systems, as well as hardware description languages such as VHDL and SystemVerilog. Also, I've been using some tools such ModelSim (and Questa) and Vivado.

- ðŸ˜„ Passionate software developer, have been working with languages such as Javascript, PHP, C#, C, C++, and Python. In the last years, I invested some time to learn could technologies, mostly including AWS tools. I have participated in many projects along my 10+ years of carrer.  

- âš¡ I'm a learner, and I'm always looking for new challenges and projects! Contact me if you have anything in mind.

A little more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... My PhD project. RTL design and simulation, approches for achieving real-time communication in manycore systems, logical synthesis, peripheral drivers, and scheduling are some of the topics that I work on daily.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Python! I recently migrated some of the tools I made to python, and I'm currently investigating ways of shipping those tools to people so that they won't have to install a bunch of unecessary stuff. 
- ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... New projects! I like to discuss business strategy and to give shape to new products, services, and ideas. I'm always eager to help in the kick off new startups.
